--> In this workshop, I learnt the concepts of member operators, operator overloading and helper functions. By default, we cannot use various operators on objects such as we cannot perform arithmetic functions on objects and we also cannot use logical and relational operators on classes. But C++ allows us to overload the default functions of these operators, so that we can use them for our convenience. For example, I created an assignment operator (=) overload in this workshop to use the assignment operator on the objects, by doing this, I specified that whenever I use the assignment operator on my class, it will behave according to the logic that I coded in the assignment operator overload. I also overloaded the type casting operators (int(), double(), bool()) in order to perform the function according to my will. Like, I overloaded the bool operator to check if my object is in a valid state which we used to do by creating a function called isValid() in the previous workshops. In addition, I also created some helper functions, to improve the efficiency of my code and making the length of code shorter.
