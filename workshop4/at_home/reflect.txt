In this workshop, I have learnt various concepts such as constructors, destructors and how to use the current object. Constructors are functions which are automatically called whenever an object is created. We have the flexibility to make more than one constructor of a single class, this helps to initialize data right along with the creation of the objects. Constructors can have any number of arguments including no arguments. I have used three type of constructors in this workshop that do their tasks based upon the number of arguments and argument data types. Moving forward, here comes the concept of destructors, there can only be one destructor in a class and that is automatically called when the object is destroyed. Destructors can be used to deallocate the memory that we used in the program to make sure that there are no memory leaks upon the successful completion of the program. In addition, I also used a type of function which returns the reference of the current object using the ‘this’ keyword, it is highly useful to have these type of functions in your program.
