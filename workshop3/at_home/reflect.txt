-> In this workshop, I have learnt about the concept of classes and privatization of data. I used two classes Bar and BarChart in this workshop which have various public and private member variables and methods. I also learnt about the difference between structures and classes, there is not a major difference, the only difference between these two is that a class by default have all the members as private but a structure have all the members as public default. Further, we can specify that which members we want to make public and the other ones should be private. Furthermore, I used a function line() to display a line of characters, instead of overloading the function, I used default argument values in this function, so that I do not have to code the same thing again and again in the program. In the line() function, we have the flexibility to pass the number of arguments according to our will, we can either pass nothing, or pass one argument or pass two arguments. I also used validation of data to ensure that the data which is going to be printed on the screen is correct.
